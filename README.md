# Action-Manager

This project was designed to understand end-to-end development of a robust MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) full stack web project. 

I have designed an efficient RESTful API, seamlessly integrating Angular's dynamic front-end with Node.js back-end. 

I have ensured optimal performance through rigorous testing and deployed the application flawlessly, enabling cross-browser accessibility.

This uses basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to perform daily tasks and keep track of them in organized manner.

I have successfully deployed the application, delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience on web browsers.
